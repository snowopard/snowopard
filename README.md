## Welcome 👋

Hi, I’m Alex 👋

Backend-leaning Full-Stack Developer

I design and implement backend-first systems with a strong focus on security, access control, and data integrity.
I’m comfortable working across the stack, but my strength is in backend architecture — APIs, authentication, authorization, auditability — and building UIs that accurately reflect backend state.

🧠 Engineering Focus

    Backend system design & API architecture
    Authentication, authorization, and RBAC
    Audit logging & data traceability
    Secure handling of sensitive data
    Clear contracts between frontend and backend
    I value explicit system behavior, clear ownership, and maintainable designs over clever abstractions.

🏗️ What You’ll See in My Repositories

    My repositories are architecture-driven, even when they include UI:
    Secure admin dashboards representing backend state
    API gateway & access-control configuration tools
    Role-based access and audit logging models
    Architecture diagrams and API examples
    The UI is used as a tool to reason about backend systems, not as the primary focus.

🛠️ Technical Stack (Representative)
    
    Backend
    REST API design
    OAuth 2.0 / JWT
    RBAC & policy enforcement
    PostgreSQL, Redis
    Go / Python / Node.js
    
    Frontend
    React / TypeScript (admin & internal tools)
    
    Practices
    Architecture-first development
    Security-aware design
    Documentation-driven APIs

🧩 Domains I’ve Worked With (Portfolio)

    Healthcare data platforms (FHIR concepts)
    FinTech transaction monitoring & fraud signals
    Secure API gateways for AI systems
    Public-sector / government-style data portals
    These projects are designed to reflect real production constraints.

🎯 What I’m Looking For

    Backend-heavy or platform-oriented roles
    Full-stack roles with real backend ownership
    Teams that care about correctness, security, and long-term maintainability
